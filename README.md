## My own Tidal Cycles Tutorial

##### maybe this can be useful for someone someday. Atm, it is only to have organized what I have been learning in Tidal.

### Cheat Sheet

#### Pattern Transformers > Event Scale <

##### change order
```c2hs 
d1 $ palindrome $ --- is the same as
d1 $ every 2 (rev) $ n 
```
```c2hs
d1 $ iter 4 $ sound
d1 $ sound $ scramble 3 "xxx*3"
d1 $ every 4 (0.25 <~) $ sound
d1 $ "<0 0.5 0.125>" <~ sound
d1 $ "[0 0.25]/4" <~ (sound "  ") 
```

##### play a fraction of a pattern
```c2hs
d1 $ linger 0.25 $ sound
d1 $ linger "<0.25 0.5 1>" $ sound
d1 $ every 2 (linger 0.25) $
d1 $ trunc "<0.75 0.25 1>" $ sound
d1 $ zoom (0.25, 0.75) $ sound
d1 $ every 4 (zoom (0.25, 0.75)) $ sound 
```
##### apply a func sometimes in a cycle
```c2hs
d1 $ sometimesBy 0.25 (somefunc) $ sound
```

##### filter events
```c2hs
d1 $ degradeBy 0.9 $ sound 
```

##### More groove
```c2hs
d1 $ brak $ sound
d1 $ swingBy (1/3) 4 $ sound
# somefunc (sine*2)
```

##### Euclidean
```c2hs
d1 $ sound "bd(3,8) sn(5,8)"
```
##### rotate
```c2hs
d1 $ sound "bd(5,8,2)"
d1 $ e 3 8 $ sound "bd*2 [sn cp]"
d1 $ sound "bd([5 3]/2,8)"
``` 

#### Pattern Transformers > Pattern Scale <

##### apply a func. in some cycles
```c2hs
d1 $ someCyclesBy 0.25 (fast 2) $ sound 
``` 

##### like multiples 'every'
```c2hs
d1 $ foldEvery [3, 4, 5] (fast 2) $ sound 
``` 
##### starts at cycle 0
```c2hs
d1 $ every' 4 0 (somefunc) $ sound
``` 
##### starts at cycle 2
```c2hs
d1 $ every' 4 2 (somefunc) $ sound 
``` 

##### Fit is cool! Use it in seqPLoop
```c2hs
d1 $ fit' 1 4 (run 4) "[0 3*2 2 1 0 3*2 2 [1*8 ~]]/2" $ s "" 
``` 

##### SPREAD!!!
```c2hs
d1 $ spread slow [2,4/3] $ sound --- is the same as
d1 $ slow "<2 4/3>" $ sound 
```
```c2hs
d1 $ spread ($) [fast 2, rev, slow 2, striate 3, (# speed "0.8")] $ sound 
```
```c2hs
d1 $ fastspread slow [2,4/3] $ sound  --- inside one cycle(?)
```

#####   Within!!!
```c2hs
d1 $ within (0, 0.5) (fast 2) $ sound
d1 $ within (0.75, 1) (# speed "0.5") $ sound 
```
```c2hs
d1 $ chunk 4 (somefunc) $ s
```

####  > Compositions <

##### One after the other
```c2hs
d1 $ seqPLoop [
  (0, 16, s "" ),
  (16, 32, s "" )
] # n (irand 16) 
```
```c2hs
d1 $ randcat[
s "  ",
s "  "
] # n ( irand 16 )
```

##### All together now
```c2hs
d2 $ stack [
  s "  ",
  s "  "
] # n (run 16) 
```

##### Both ways!!!
```c2hs
d2 $ seqPLoop [
  (0, 32, stack [
    slow 2 $ s "  " # gain 1.5,
    s "  " # gain 0.8
  ] ),
  (32, 64, stack[
    s "  ",
    s "  "
  ] )
] 
```

#### > Utility <

```c2hs
d1 $ sound "xxx*4" # speed (rand + 0.5)
d1 $ n (run "<4 8 4 6>") # sound
(scale 0.25 0.75 $ rand)
# somefunc (slow 4 $ sine * 0.5 + 1)
# somefunc (scale (-2) 3 $ tri)
# somefunc (slow 8 $ saw)
d1 $ s " xxxx*4 " # n (choose [0,2,5]) 
```
##### constrain continuous pattern's speed
```c2hs
d1 $ s (discretise 1 $ choose["kif", "kip"]) 
d1 $ s (struct "x ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~" $ choose["kif", "kip"]) 
solo $ d1 $ 
```

#### > Transitions <

```c2hs
t1 (clutchIn 8) $ sound 
t2 (jumpIn' 1) $ 
```

### Slack Excerpts


averageaht 5:43 PM
> I know this information can be put together from the tutorial, but I can't figure it out: 
  How can I play a chord progression that lasts more than a single cycle (say, 6 quarter notes) every N cycles?
> assume 4/4 time. every 4 measures I want to play some notes, say ``` "c1 e1 g1 b1 d1" ``` , all quarter notes
  let me know if that's clear or not
  I know I can pitch notes with up or use midinotes to create the notes
  I can get something to happen every 4 measures using every 4, but this seems like a hack:
  ```c2hs 
  d1 $ every 4 (const $ sound "bd") $ sound "~" 
  ```
> guess I use slowcat to create a pattern longer than a single cycle

efairbanks 9:11 PM
> You can use slow and fast to change the speed of a Pattern, not just ParamPatterns.

yaxu 9:12 PM
> is this what you want? 
  ```c2hs 
 "<[c1 e1 g1 b1] [d1 ~ ~ ~] ~ ~>"
 ```
efairbanks 9:13 PM
```c2hs 
d1 $ s "pluck*2" # up (slow 8 "0 3 5 7") 
```
> Or even
  ```c2hs 
d1 $ s "pluck*2" |*| up "[0,3,7]" |*| up (slow 8 "0 3 5 7") 
```
> If you want to get more advanced, you can apply a slow progression to multiple elements:
```c2hs
do
  cps 1
  let progression p = p |*| up (slow 8 $ "0 5 10 7")
  let melody = progression $ stut 4 0.3 1.033 $ fast 2 $ up "0 3 7 10" |*| up "12" # s "pluck"
  let bass = progression $ s "pluck" |*| speed "0.5" |*| gain "1.0" # shape 0.6 # cut "-1"
  d1 $ stack [melody, bass]
```

averageaht 9:16 PM
> \@yaxu yes, that is what I want, can I slow that down so that it happens in 2 cycles I guess?

averageaht 9:17 PM
> \@efairbanks I dont get why the plucks are playing twice in your example, even if I remove *2
  oh, I guess 8/4=2

averageaht 9:18 PM
```c2hs
  d1 $ s "pluck" # up (slow 6 "0 3 5 7 9 11") 
```  
  works

efairbanks 9:19 PM
> Yeah, and there slow is essentially changing the length of a cycle.
  So you could alternate between two melodies per cycle like so:
```c2hs
d1 $ s "pluck" # up (slow 6 "<[0 3 5 7 9 11] [2 4 8 11 13 15]>") 
```

averageaht 9:20 PM
> hmm I don't want to change the length of the cycle

efairbanks 9:21 PM
> It's only changing it local to the Pattern, not globally.

averageaht 9:21 PM
> how do I get something that's "in time" with my other patterns?

efairbanks 9:21 PM
> Another way to think of slow is that it slows down the time that the pattern is receiving, so to speak.
> The pattern: 
```c2hs 
"<[0 3 5 7 9 11] [2 4 8 11 13 15]>" 
```
> is operating on a different time scale than the "pluck" pattern because  you've slowed it.
> But you could then do.
```c2hs 
 d1 $ (s "pluck" # up (slow 6 "<[0 3 5 7 9 11] [2 4 8 11 13 15]>")) |*| up "0 7 12" 
 ```
> And the cycle ``` "0 7 12" ``` is being evaluated after all that, so it is operating at the normal time scale and will occupy one normal cycle.
  
> I mean, not strictly. There are a lot of ways to achieve what you want to do. 
  The ``` <> ``` mean "every cycle play the next element within <>"
  Where each element occupies one cycle.
  And then the whole thing is being slowed by a factor of 6.

averageaht 9:26 PM
> okay, so there are six notes in those two cycles
  
efairbanks
> 6 notes in one cycle, 6 notes in the next.
  And because the whole thing is slowed by a factor of 6 after that, each cycle is 6 times as long as it normally would be.
  So each note ends up being the length of "one cycle" from a global reference point.

averageaht 9:27 PM
> so I guess the alternative to ``` <> ``` is ``` slowcat ```?
  
yaxu 9:28 PM
> an important point is that tidal has no fixed idea of what a beat is
  the reference point is (almost) always the cycle

averageaht 9:30 PM
> hmm I got the impression a cycle was a measure

efairbanks 9:32 PM
> Yeah, cycles are more like units of time, and time is malleable in Tidal.
  Tempo is defined in cycles per second rather than BPM.

anny 9:32 PM
> cps 1 == bpm 60

yaxu 9:33 PM
> only if you put four events per cycle

efairbanks 9:33 PM
> ^ depending on if you want to think of a cycle as a beat.

yaxu 9:34 PM
> cps 1 feels like 120 bpm to me

averageaht 9:35 PM
> why doesn't this work?
```c2hs 
d1 $ slowcat [s "pluck*4" # up "[0 3 5 7]", s "pluck*2 ~ ~" # up "9 11 0 0 "] 
```

yaxu 9:35 PM
> but if you put three events in a cycle it'll feel like a different bpm

efairbanks 9:36 PM
> /@averageaht works for me

> But!
  
> This ``` "pluck*2 ~ ~" ```
> Does not mean
  ``` "pluck pluck ~ ~" ```
> It means
``` "[pluck pluck] ~ ~" ```
> That's why it's playing the 9 twice.
> The up pattern hasn't switched to 0 yet.

averageaht 9:36 PM
> hmm for me it's playing the 9 twice

yaxu 9:37 PM
> yes the second pluck will start 1/6th of the way into each cycle

efairbanks 9:37 PM
```c2hs 
d1 $ slowcat [s "pluck*4" # up "[0 3 5 7]", s "pluck pluck ~ ~" # up "9 11 0 0 "] 
``` 
>works the way you'd expect.

yaxu 9:38 PM
> you can do ``` "pluck!2 ~ ~" ``` for that

efairbanks 9:39 PM
> btw \@averageaht if you want to apply the same progression to multiple patterns, you can do stuff like this: 
```c2hs 
 d1 $ slow 2 $
     stack [s "bass:3(3,8)", s "pluck(5,8,2)" # up "24"] |*| up (slow 4 "0 5 7 0") 
```

averageaht 9:39 PM
> I can see how angle brackets are useful if cycle=beat. unfortunately they seem to just "not work" for me. I get:
  no synth or sample named 'nil' could be found.
  instrument not found: nil

yaxu 9:39 PM
> well if you just want to repeat once you can do ``` "pluck ! ~ ~" ```

anny 9:39 PM
> ``` pluck ! ``` has the same effect - number is optional. ``` pluck !!! ``` also

efairbanks 9:40 PM
> That's cool as heck. 
  Is there way to tell Tidal to continue the last note instead of cutting it off in the case of using cut 
  or synthdefs as well? I heard something about _ but last time I tried it, it didn't work for me.

  oh actually there is @

  added this Smalltalk snippet  (n.a. this is cool! Promising!)
  
```Smalltalk
Tidal {
  classvar ghci, ghciOutput;

  *new {
    ^this.start();
  }

  *start {
    if ( currentEnvironment.at(\tidal).isNil ){
      ~tidal = this;
      ghci = Pipe.new("ghci -XOverloadedStrings", "w");
      ghciOutput = Routine {
        var line = ghci.getLine;
        while(
          { line.notNil },
          {
            line.postln;
            line = ghci.getLine;
          }
        );
        ghci.close;
      };
    };
  }

  *send {
    |message|

    ghci.write("%\n".format(message));
    ghci.flush;
  }

  *stop {
    ghci.close;
    ~tidal = nil;
  }

}
```

mauro 2:47 PM

  with a little help of @munshkr, it's possible to talk to tidal from supercollider
```c2hs
Tidal.start;
Tidal.send(":module Sound.Tidal.Context");
Tidal.send("(cps, getNow) <- bpsUtils");
Tidal.send("(d1,t1) <- superDirtSetters getNow");
Tidal.send(":set prompt ".format("tidal> ".quote));
Tidal.send("d1 $ sound % # release 0.25".format("kick".quote));
Tidal.send("d1 silence");
Tidal.stop;
```

  Ooh, hadn't realized that there's no reason custom effects can't also use parameters like n (or freq).
  Note-following filter:

```361
~dirt.addModule( \lpf2, {|dirtEvent| dirtEvent.sendSynth("dirt_lpf2" ++ ~dirt.numChannels,
    [cutoff2: ~cutoff2, freq:~freq, resonance:~resonance, out: ~out])}, {~cutoff2.notNil});

SynthDef("dirt_lpf2"++~dirt.numChannels, {|out, cutoff2=0, resonance, freq|
    var sig;
    sig = In.ar(out, ~dirt.numChannels);
    sig = RLPF.ar(sig, freq*(1+cutoff2), resonance.linexp(0, 1, 1, 0.001));
    ReplaceOut.ar(out, sig);
}).add;
```

danielmkarlsson 5:51 PM
> Hey gang.
  I'd like to choose a new value for a sine envelope each time that particular envelope has completed its full duration.
  This example chooses a new value for the sine envelope each cycle which is not what I want:
```c2hs
d1 $ s "bass1:4*8" # cut 1 # gain (slow (choose [1..16]) $ scale 0 1 $ sine) 
```
  That said, you can fake it for a finite amount of time with seqP
  
```c2hs
let randomList sn len = map (ceiling . (* sn) . timeToRand) [1..len]
let cycleSines sn len = seqP $ map (\(a,b,c) -> (fromIntegral a, fromIntegral b, slow (fromIntegral c) sine)) $ zip3 x0 x1 r
       where x0 = take (length r - 1) $ scanl (+) 0 r
             x1 = scanl1 (+) r
             r = randomList sn len
```

> so `cycleSines 16 100` will give you a series of sines with a `slow` in the range 1..16, and repeat for 100 sine cycles,
  which in this case is about to cycle count 850 (because of the random lengths).

> Note that due to the way "random" numbers work, this will give the same exact sequence each time you 
  use the same `sn` and  `len`. If you want to mix things up you can change up the `[1..len]` in randomList
```c2hs
let randomList' sn len k = map (ceiling . (* sn) . timeToRand . (+ k)) [1..len]` would give a different result for different `k
```
* [further footnote, `sine` starts its cycle at its midpoint, 0.5, if you want the waves to "reset" their cycle at 0.0 I think you can just rotate it, replacing `sine` with `0.25 ~> sine`]
